It's challenging to ascertain the goal without more context, but I will follow the pattern for the provided input as a guide. If 35 is in a similar setup, considering different numbers might be involved, we'd consider pairs of numbers around the number 35, perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (if feasible), and list what would be left afterwards. However, since there's only one number given, it would typically involve manipulation with itself or the presence of a presumed number for operation, which is unclear from the single value given.\n",
